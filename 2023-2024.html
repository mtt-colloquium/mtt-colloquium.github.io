      <p> Offshore Wind Farms are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development, nevertheless, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs can account for approximately 25-30% of the total cost. 
          The challenges related to O&M can be categorized into three main echelons, depending on the time-horizon of reference. The long-term horizon is typically focused on the overall maintenance strategy for the wind farm. The medium-term horizon is focused on the selection of the fleet and the management of spare parts. The short-term time horizon is focused on the scheduling of individual maintenance tasks on a daily or weekly basis and the routing of the vessels.
          A critical literature review on the topic exposed the lack of comprehensive models and methods that encompass all time horizons holistically and showed that O&M strategies often prioritize cost-effectiveness while overlooking environmental considerations.
          This project aims to develop a holistic framework for the optimization of O&M decision-making for offshore wind, that integrates the decisions and information belonging to the three time horizons while also considering environmental and sustainability aspects.
          A baseline O&M simulation model has been developed to simulate the prediction and execution of maintenance activities and track the associated costs throughout the lifetime of an offshore wind farm, this model can currently be used to assess the effectiveness of different O&M strategies and its results will be used as reference for further optimization. Furthermore, a short-term optimization model based on prognostic-driven maintenance scheduling is under development.
          By implementing more efficient and dynamic O&M models, operators can reduce the frequency of maintenance activities, minimize downtime, and increase the availability and performance of the wind farm.

      <p> Solid hydrogen carriers, such as sodium borohydride or potassium borohydride, are seen as promising options to enable the use of hydrogen as a fuel for maritime vessels, because of their favourable gravimetric and volumetric energy density compared to compressed or liquefied hydrogen. When using solid hydrogen carriers as fuel for maritime vessels, a ’spent fuel’ (sodium/potassium metaborate) forms, which has to be stored on the vessel for the remainder of the voyage. Furthermore, the spent fuel has to be regenerated (e.g. using ball-milling) upon arrival at the destination port in order to achieve circularity. To design the required storage and handling equipment to realize this circular bunkering process, the mechanical characteristics of both the fuel and the spent fuel, e.g. particle size distribution, internal friction, cohesion, wall-friction, and flowability are required. Consequently, during the first part of my research, I aim to identify and experimentally determine the relevant mechanical characteristics of sodium borohydride (fuel) and sodium metaborate (spent fuel) in the context of bunkering maritime vessels. Using the found characteristics, my objective is to use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the behaviour of the fuel and spent fuel. Finally, if the simulations are verified and validated, I will use this knowledge to propose guidelines for the design for storage and handling equipment, both on-board of the vessel and in the port.

      <p> It would be nice if we all knew what we were doing, what we want to do in the future, and never made mistakes while trying to get to that future. But that doesn’t happen in real life. We gain experience by trying new things, figure out what we like by discovering what we don’t like, sometimes get rejected from what we think we want to do, and will (unfortunately, but necessarily) make some mistakes along the way. That’s at least been my experience. But on the other hand, I thoroughly enjoy what I do, am optimistic about the future, and in general do not feel stressed by this work. How can these two states (sometimes painfully gaining experience by learning on the job, while still enjoying the job) exist together? That’s what I’d like to discuss during the social talk.

      <p> Recent trends towards electrification introduced a variety of new components into vessel energy systems. Since this adds additional degrees of flexibility to the energy management of the load sharing between different power sources, determining the problem optimal operating point of each subsystem increased in complexity. Furthermore, reduction of fuel consumption is not the only objective of interest in the control anymore. Ideally, the energy management has to take all relevant objectives, such as fuel consumption, emission production, or component health, into account for determining an optimal power split. Since commonly used rule-based strategies provide suboptimal solutions for multi-objective problems, using optimization-based control strategies can become necessary to achieve optimal energy system operation. In this talk, I’ll give an introduction into the problem, my current research on multi-objective energy management using an instantaneous optimization approach and its limitations.

      <p> What happens to a ship’s hull in case of a collision, grounding or impact? Is it possible to accurately simulate what happens to a ship in such a scenario using finite element with the current computational capabilities? Mult-Scale Failure Modelling could help make such simulations more practically feasible in the short term. The research question will first be introduced in a real world scenario and the gap between the current computational simulation capabilities and the scale required for high fidelity results will be illustrated. The current work within my project to bridge this considerable gap will then be presented in a more simplified case. Focus will be given on how to analytically model the necking phenomena (which is generally considered to be the principle cause of mesh sensitivity in plasticity simulations) in the plane strain case. The roadmap towards extending the current work towards more generalised cases will then be discussed in light of some open questions to the audience.

      <p> Marine propeller design is a cornerstone of naval architecture and marine engineering, serving as a classic optimization problem that has captivated the attention of scholars, engineers, and practitioners for generations. The challenge lies in developing efficient, reliable, and cost-effective propellers that excel in various operating conditions while adhering to strict environmental regulations and addressing noise and vibration concerns. 
          As a critical component in the propulsion systems of ships, submarines, and other marine vessels, the marine propeller's design directly impacts vessel performance, fuel consumption, and emissions.
          Marine propellers often operate under uncertain conditions, including inflow, rate of revolutions, and manufacturing tolerances. 

          On the one hand, a deterministic design approach that does not consider these stochastic inputs can lead to excessive sensitivity to slight variations in operational conditions, resulting in a sub-optimal geometry for real-world functioning scenarios. On the other hand, the computational effort required to quantify the design's uncertainties may be prohibitive even when mid-fidelity solvers, like Boundary Element Methods (BEM), are employed in Simulation-Based Design Optimization.

          As in the case of deterministic design optimizations driven by mid-fidelity codes, Machine Learning methodologies represent a computational booster of the procedure. 
          By realizing computationally cheap yet accurate surrogate models of the key performance indicators of the design, they allow for the hundreds of thousands of calculations needed by sampling methods to evaluate the uncertainty of the design and drive the process towards configurations less sensitive to input variations, making the non-deterministic design optimization a feasible alternative to conventional deterministic design-by-optimization methodologies. 

          In this talk, deterministic and non-deterministic designs are carried out in the case of a conventional propeller, considering uncertainties of the nominal functioning conditions. 
          BEMs computations are used to train accurate Machine Learning-based surrogate models. Thanks to their cost-effectiveness in the forward phase, they enable the assessment of the uncertainties necessary for a non-deterministic design optimization framework. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, the optimal geometries attained through the utilization of surrogates are re-tested utilizing medium-fidelity BEM solvers to validate the superior performance of the non-deterministic design approach.

      <p> A wave impacting the deck and superstructure of a ship is called green water. Green water is rare and complex and can be a danger to the ship and those aboard. During the design process, the risks that these events pose have to be mitigated, preferably by minimizing the probability of a large impact occurring. As green water events are rare and complex it is difficult to get a statistically representative data set, thus previous work has mostly compared design variations through a limited number of events, instead of comparing the probabilities. The present study uses probabilities to compare design variations. A large set of green water events in irregular waves with forward velocity was experimentally obtained for six different bow designs using a novel continuous testing facility. The resulting data gives us interesting insights, showing us the importance of using statistically representative data sets when designing for green water.

      <p> This presentation will focus on the current state of my PhD research, into the application of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) within combined cycle systems on board ships. The SOFC has been recognized as one of the promising technologies to reduce GHG emissions. However, this type of fuel cell comes with its challenges that have to be overcome before it actually can be applied on board a ship. The integration of an SOFC with bottoming/topping cycles could address some of these challenges. In this talk, an analysis of the current state of SOFC-combined cycle research in the maritime environment is addressed, together with an initial thermodynamic analysis of a combined SOFC-PEMFC cycle system.

      <p> Predicting wave impact design loads is crucial for the safety and performance of maritime structures, as demonstrated by several recent accidents. However, it is also challenging due to the complexity and rarity of the wave impact events. Highly nonlinear responses such as wave impacts require a fidelity level that can only be achieved with expensive CFD or experiments. Impact loads are also rare; they do not occur every wave encounter. In order to evaluate their statistics, we therefore need to evaluate long durations. With the present computational power, it is not practically feasible to evaluate several times the lifetime of the ship with high-fidelity tools. We therefore need some kind of multi-fidelity modelling, combining the benefits of fast low-fidelity tools and accurate high-fidelity tools. Existing multi-fidelity methods are mainly suitable for prediction of weakly non-linear responses, or are very computationally expensive. A new event-based multi-fidelity method called ‘adaptive screening’ therefore combines elements of screening, multi-fidelity Gaussian Process Regression and adaptive sampling, to more efficiently predict highly non-linear loads with sparsely populated exceedance distributions. A simplified case study using second-order wave data shows that the new method predicts more accurate short-term design loads than the conventional methods, while also significantly reducing the required HF simulation time. The next step will be to validate the method against long duration wave impact experiments.

      <p> Methanol has emerged as a cost-effective and scalable alternative fuel for the maritime sector. However, the utilization of methanol in marine engines is hindered by the lack of understanding on its spray characteristics, especially under port fuel injection (PFI) conditions. This research aims to investigate the characteristics of methanol sprays under conditions relevant to marine engines. The proposed methodology evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in simulating PFI conditions. The CFD models leverage the Lagrangian-Eulerian (LE) coupling method within the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) turbulence framework. Moreover, the predictive capabilities of different spray sub-models are investigated. The intention is to implement these spray sub-models into a validated 3D CFD engine model that will demystify the operation of methanol marine engines and, contribute to the decarbonization of the maritime industry.

      <p> Picking up a PhD study with retirement in sight is far beyond career planning. However, it is an extraordinary experience to encounter the friction between the engineering and the scientific world. This mini-symposium aims at an overview of characteristic moments in time that led to this experience. Forty years in engineering results easily in a strong focus on a reliable solution in as little time as possible. Common sense in time and money driven projects collides often with the broad mindset required in the scientific environment. These collisions characterise 40 years in the engineering world and an additional 8 years in academia.
