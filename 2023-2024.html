      <p> Predicting wave impact design loads is crucial for the safety and performance of maritime structures, as demonstrated by several recent accidents. However, it is also challenging due to the complexity and rarity of the wave impact events. Highly nonlinear responses such as wave impacts require a fidelity level that can only be achieved with expensive CFD or experiments. Impact loads are also rare; they do not occur every wave encounter. In order to evaluate their statistics, we therefore need to evaluate long durations. With the present computational power, it is not practically feasible to evaluate several times the lifetime of the ship with high-fidelity tools. We therefore need some kind of multi-fidelity modelling, combining the benefits of fast low-fidelity tools and accurate high-fidelity tools. Existing multi-fidelity methods are mainly suitable for prediction of weakly non-linear responses, or are very computationally expensive. A new event-based multi-fidelity method called ‘adaptive screening’ therefore combines elements of screening, multi-fidelity Gaussian Process Regression and adaptive sampling, to more efficiently predict highly non-linear loads with sparsely populated exceedance distributions. A simplified case study using second-order wave data shows that the new method predicts more accurate short-term design loads than the conventional methods, while also significantly reducing the required HF simulation time. The next step will be to validate the method against long duration wave impact experiments.

      <p> Methanol has emerged as a cost-effective and scalable alternative fuel for the maritime sector. However, the utilization of methanol in marine engines is hindered by the lack of understanding on its spray characteristics, especially under port fuel injection (PFI) conditions. This research aims to investigate the characteristics of methanol sprays under conditions relevant to marine engines. The proposed methodology evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in simulating PFI conditions. The CFD models leverage the Lagrangian-Eulerian (LE) coupling method within the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) turbulence framework. Moreover, the predictive capabilities of different spray sub-models are investigated. The intention is to implement these spray sub-models into a validated 3D CFD engine model that will demystify the operation of methanol marine engines and, contribute to the decarbonization of the maritime industry.
