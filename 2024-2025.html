				<h3><b> A validated DEM modelling framework on plate and pile penetrations in a double-layer scour protection  </b></h3>
				<h5>

				<p>
					Monopiles are the dominant foundation type for offshore wind turbines, accounting for approximately 80% of the installed capacity. Installing offshore monopile foundations requires monopiles to penetrate several pre-installed scour protection rock layers before securing them into the seabed. With the increasing power of the wind turbines, both the size of the monopile and the scour protection rocks increase. The accurate prediction of the penetration resistance is crucial to ensure successful monopile installations. To facilitate or even replace the costly and labour-intensive experimental small-scale penetration tests, a numerical model has been developed using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) that captures the discrete nature of interactions between rocks and piles and predicts the resistance during the penetration process. The developed DEM model includes armour and filter rocks represented by multispheres and sand particles by spheres. A multistage calibration, verification and validation DEM modelling framework is proposed and examined with small-scale penetration tests conducted using plates and piles in a bilayer scour protection configuration. The sand material model is calibrated and verified using penetrometer tests and the rock material models are calibrated and verified using a plate penetration test. The verified model predicts the penetration resistance well in small-scale pile penetration tests and proves the validity of the proposed framework. The proposed framework facilitates the modelling area where traditional continuum-based numerical methods give less accurate predictions and allow us to achieve further insights that are hardly or nearly impossible to obtain by experiments.

				<h3><b> Efficient Constraint Multi-Objective Optimization with Applications in Ship Design </b></h3>
				<h5>
					Roy de Winter

			</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>
					In this talk I will introduce the work that I conducted during my PhD at C-Job Naval Architects and the Natural Computing group of Leiden University. The main contribution of my thesis are efficient multi-objective optimization algorithms that can also handle constraints. I worked on and discovered several different strategies that speed up the optimization process despite the expensive nature of the objective and constraint functions. The algorithm that I will introduce in this talk is the IOC-SAMO-COBRA algorithm that has been used to optimize the damage stability criteria and the cargo hold volume of a single hold cargo ship by adjusting the bulkhead positions. The IOC-SAMO-COBRA algorithm incorporates all the techniques and recommendations discovered during my PhD, which include: 1) Use an as small as possible initial design of experiments for faster convergence, 2) Adaptively chose the best surrogate fit, 3) The use of uncertainty quantification methodologies is redundant when doing multi-objective optimization, 4) I t is possible to propose multiple solutions per iteration by using the hypervolume performance indicator, and finally 5) Combining inexpensive constraint and objective functions with surrogate models for expensive functions leads to better Pareto frontier approximations.

				<h3><b> Towards sub-grid scale bubble modeling and Characterizing numerical artifacts in multiphase simulation  </b></h3>
				<h5>
					Tzu-Yao Huang

			</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>
					Simulating bubbly flows is challenging, particularly at high Reynolds (Re) and Weber (We) numbers, where bubble sizes vary significantly. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally infeasible for high-momentum cases like those induced by Olympic divers. To address this, we aim to develop a sub-grid scale (SGS) bubble model that ensures coarse grid solutions align with real-world data. Along the way, we identified an intriguing numerical artifact in sharp interface simulations, which we call ‘numerical shape diffusion.’ This presentation will cover our progress toward creating an SGS bubble model and our insights into these numerical artifacts in multiphase simulations.

				<h3><b> Towards Adaptive Manufacturing Systems: Planning and scheduling methods for more sustainable and resilient factories </b></h3>
				<h5>
					Rafael Leite Patrão

			</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>
					The manufacturing sector faces increasing uncertainty due to systemic changes like the green and digital transitions. These changes offer opportunities for factories to become more sustainable and resilient, but they also create significant challenges for decision-makers at strategic, tactical, and operational levels. To help factories adapt while maintaining production goals, we explored two key technological enablers: reconfigurable machines and machine learning techniques. We defined a manufacturing system that is both highly sustainable and resilient, using such enablers, as an adaptive manufacturing system. To drive existing factories towards greater adaptability over time, while minimizing production disruptions, we develop production planning and scheduling models that consider sustainability and resiliency metrics and integrate both technological enablers.

				<h3><b> On physical-constraints in Scientific Machine Learning for fast flow field predictions  </b></h3>
				<h5>
					Manuel Cabral
				</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>
					Traditional fluid simulations, while highly accurate, are often too slow for many practical applications. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative due to its ability to deliver fast predictions. However, ensuring the accuracy and physical consistency of these models requires the incorporation of physical priors. In this talk, we explore methods for embedding physical laws — such as symmetries and governing equations — into machine learning models, with a focus on fluid dynamics. By integrating these priors, we develop models that are not only more data-efficient but also smaller, making them well-suited for real-world applications where data and computational resources are often limited. Furthermore, we show that these physics-based models generalize better to previously unseen flow regimes, offering improved performance over purely data-driven approaches.

				<h3><b> Digital Potential in Shipyards: A Path to Transformation </b></h3>
				<h5>
					Miguel Calvache

			</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>
					Before diving into academia, I spent several years in the navy and the shipbuilding industry, where I saw firsthand the challenges shipyards face in keeping up with digital transformation. Now, as a PhD researcher, my work explores how digital technologies can reshape shipbuilding processes, addressing declining throughput and competitiveness. Using a mathematical model, I (try to) analyze the financial benefits of various technologies and apply innovation theories to understand why shipyards have been slow to adopt new systems. Join me this week as I share my journey from shipbuilding to digital transformation, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for the industry in the digital age.

                    The widespread adoption of data-driven modeling tools and advances in hardware architectures across the scientific computing community have also shaped the future of CFD solvers. In this context, we will review the opportunities and challenges arising from the use of ML models in scale-resolving turbulent flow simulations. As examples, the cases of data-driven turbulence modelling, and active flow control using reinforcement learning will be discussed. We will also introduce our flagship CFD solver, WaterLily, and discuss future research directions.
