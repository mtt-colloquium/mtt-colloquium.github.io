        Flexible composite marine propellers have the potential to reduce the electromagnetic and acoustic signatures of maritime vehicles, as well as reducing their carbon emissions [1], [2]. There are however large uncertainties in the material properties and damage progression in composite materials. In-service monitoring of loads and damage to the blades may provide useful input for improved operation and estimation of the remaining lifetime [3]. This presentation will highlight current progress on the measurement and analysis of vibrations and acoustic emissions (AE) in composite marine propeller blades using a network of embedded piezoelectric sensors. In this regard, a framework is shown for the reconstruction of vibrations, together with preliminary measurements on blade in dry condition. Further, the measurement and processing of AE signals is outlined. This is aimed at damage localization and characterization. Considerations concerning the non-homogeneity and anisotropy of the propeller blade are explained. Initial results on AE measurements from the blade are also displayed.

        The global population is increasing and due to which there will be a surge in energy and materials demand worldwide. The transition from fossil fuel based technologies to clean energy technologies is crucial in order to maintain a low carbon future. Clean energy technologies are metal intensive which requires critical raw materials such as nickel, cobalt and rare earth metals. Due to depletion of mineral deposits and reduction of ore grade of the land based mines, the industry is compelled to look for alternative resources for these materials. Thus, deep sea mining is looked at a viable option. Deep sea mining impose threat to the deep-sea environment due to the generation of sediment plumes which could potentially eradicate benthic communities living in the deep sea. It is expected that flocculation will help in reducing the sediment dispersion due to deep sea mining, which will be studied in this research.

      <p>Container transport via inland waterways currently faces several challenges affecting its competitiveness with other modes. These challenges include the high waiting times and the low priority given to container barges in deep-sea ports. To mitigate these challenges, a new concept known as the Modular Mobile Terminal (MMT) is introduced to create a dedicated floating barge handling and consolidation space for containers. Based on this, an evaluation framework examining the feasibility of the MMT from a logistical and economic perspective is proposed. In particular, a time optimization model was developed to determine the MMT configuration leading to the most time savings for container barges. It also helps targeting a potential market by determining the hinterland flows that can be positively linked to the MMTs. Afterward, an economic evaluation is conducted to estimate the cost savings for the actors and figure out under which conditions the actors would benefit from using the MMT system. It can be concluded that the MMTs are most suitable for handling and consolidating cargoes from container barges with small call sizes.

      <p>Soft grippers show adaptability and flexibility in grasping irregularly shaped and fragile objects. However, small-scaled deformation, low loading capacity, and limited shaped fitting ability of the soft grippers are the main limitations for the development of large-scale applications, especially for heavy objects or objects with sharp edges. To overcome the limitations, a new concept of a soft actuator with engineered smart particles is proposed. The proposed soft actuator is a dual-chambers structure filled with different particles, which can be driven by particle expanding or covered membrane shrinking. Compared to the other soft actuators, the combination of granular materials and smart materials is used in the new concept instead of the traditional actuation method, which delivers better performances of large-scale deformation, variable stiffness, and high-level adaptability. To describe the concept, a numerical method of the coupling of the discrete element method (DEM) and the finite element method (FEM) is presented to achieve the design and investigate the influent factors. The results indicated, that the proposed soft gripper exhibited the functionality of large deformation by a shrinking membrane or deformed particles. In general, in a certain range, the bending angle and deflections of the gripper actuator increase with the growth of particle diameter ratio, actuator length, and elastic modulus of membrane material.  However, the bending angle will decrease when the membrane's actuator length and elastic modulus increase after a certain level. Hence, the choice of different parameters needs to be reasonable to achieve the required deformation. In conclusion, the grasping gripper actuator can realize the large bending deformation but performs differently under different influence parameters. Thus, the proposed novel actuator shows potential for the development of soft grippers in multi-scale physical scenarios.

      <h3><b>Extreme aerated water-wave impacts on floating bodies: The relevance of air content in water on ship design loads</b></h3>

        The past showed that offshore structures still experience catastrophic impact loadings, even though they are designed according to the regulations. The complexity of water wave events interacting with other substances, like structures and air, makes it hard to predict the design loads. An example is a breaking wave that encloses air pockets. These pockets fragment into smaller ones, air entrainment, which can remain for a long time in the water. Where pure water is (almost) incompressible, the air is the opposite, affecting the properties of the air-water mixture.

In my Ph.D., which has been going on for almost four years, I developed a numerical CFD method from scratch for modeling wave impacts. The model can deal with the properties of a homogeneous air-water mixture and shows promising results compared to the experimental results of an in-house setup.

During the four years of my Ph.D., I took some side roads to improve the numerical method for e.g. high-density ratio interfacial flows, fluid-structure interaction, and continuous geometrical interface reconstruction. Out of my comfort zone, an experimental setup for a 2D wedge entry in “homogeneous” aerated water is designed.

        As researchers in academia, we are continuously faced with choices and challenges. Do I want an academic career? What is the best next step? Am I good enough? Where and how can I make a contribution? Why do reviewers not understand my excellent work? Sometimes we have successes, most of the time, we are struggling. During this presentation, I want to share something of my own choices and challenges. I am convinced this will give some insight into the beauty of electrical power engineering. I also hope this will stimulate thinking about how (not) to develop an academic career.

        Early-stage design of complex systems, such as naval vessels, is considered by many to be one of the most critical design phases because many of the major design decisions are being made, and as a consequence, most of the costs are committed. 
The naval architect needs to assess a large amount of designs to identify the most promising trends and key trade-offs. Traditionally, the fidelity of the analysis tools, used to assess the designs, increases gradually throughout the design process. Thus, early-stage exploration is based on low fidelity tools such as simplified physical models, data from reference designs, empirical and semi-empirical methods. However, low fidelity tools are not sufficient for the design of novel vessels. Introducing high fidelity tools earlier on in the process is a challenge which can be addressed by introducing multi-fidelity models (MFMs).
My PhD work is part of a NWO funded project, which aims to assess extreme wave loading early on in the design process. My research aims to develop a multi-fidelity framework to support early stage design exploration of novel and reliable vessels.

        It has been stated that noise is one of the main causes of not only structural damage but also hearing injury to species living around the noise source. A well-known noise problem is the sound produced by the process of driving an offshore monopile into the seabed, which is a common foundation used during the installation of wind farms. The current noise-control techniques used in this process still face challenges in reducing low-frequency noise, which can also be harmful to marine life. To overcome this limitation, this project proposes an elastic metamaterial-based structure composed by single-phase resonant structures. The proposed structure will be used to remove energy from the input signal related to high noise levels. The presented device opens the door for the development of less complex structures with potential in reducing noise directly from the source.

        Welded joints are often weak links in structures. Friction stir welding, originally developed for softer materials like magnesium and aluminium, has shown to be a very promising technique for manufacturing as well as weld repairs.
        However, friction stir welding in steel comes with its own set of problems. One of which is that steel undergoes phase transformations during the process, meaning that the mechanical properties of the material change. Moreover, the resulting mechanical properties of the joint depend on the welding parameters, such as the welding speed and rotation speed of the tool.
        Mechanical properties of friction stir welded joints in steel are not well understood. The project goal is to characterize and optimize the mechanical performance of friction stir welded joints in steel maritime structures. The current research is focused on static strength, fatigue strength and microstructural properties of friction stir welded joints in steel.

        In the last decade machine learning has become a buzzword in scientific modelling, but is this really a new universal approach or just a way to get new papers using regression methods that are 200 years old? In this presentation, I’ll highlight a few examples of the capabilities and limitations of applying modern machine learning to solve unsteady hydrodynamic problems. These range from the deseptively simple underwater pendulum to the well know open problem of predicting the forces induced by the turbulent wake of a circular cylinder. I will also discuss the critical role of the user in defining the problem representation and in applying the right machine learning tool for the right problem.
