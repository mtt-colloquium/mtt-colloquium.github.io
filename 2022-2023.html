        The past showed that offshore structures still experience catastrophic impact loadings, even though they are designed according to the regulations. The complexity of water wave events interacting with other substances, like structures and air, makes it hard to predict the design loads. An example is a breaking wave that encloses air pockets. These pockets fragment into smaller ones, air entrainment, which can remain for a long time in the water. Where pure water is (almost) incompressible, the air is the opposite, affecting the properties of the air-water mixture.

In my Ph.D., which has been going on for almost four years, I developed a numerical CFD method from scratch for modeling wave impacts. The model can deal with the properties of a homogeneous air-water mixture and shows promising results compared to the experimental results of an in-house setup.

During the four years of my Ph.D., I took some side roads to improve the numerical method for e.g. high-density ratio interfacial flows, fluid-structure interaction, and continuous geometrical interface reconstruction. Out of my comfort zone, an experimental setup for a 2D wedge entry in “homogeneous” aerated water is designed.

        As researchers in academia, we are continuously faced with choices and challenges. Do I want an academic career? What is the best next step? Am I good enough? Where and how can I make a contribution? Why do reviewers not understand my excellent work? Sometimes we have successes, most of the time, we are struggling. During this presentation, I want to share something of my own choices and challenges. I am convinced this will give some insight into the beauty of electrical power engineering. I also hope this will stimulate thinking about how (not) to develop an academic career.

        Early-stage design of complex systems, such as naval vessels, is considered by many to be one of the most critical design phases because many of the major design decisions are being made, and as a consequence, most of the costs are committed. 
The naval architect needs to assess a large amount of designs to identify the most promising trends and key trade-offs. Traditionally, the fidelity of the analysis tools, used to assess the designs, increases gradually throughout the design process. Thus, early-stage exploration is based on low fidelity tools such as simplified physical models, data from reference designs, empirical and semi-empirical methods. However, low fidelity tools are not sufficient for the design of novel vessels. Introducing high fidelity tools earlier on in the process is a challenge which can be addressed by introducing multi-fidelity models (MFMs).
My PhD work is part of a NWO funded project, which aims to assess extreme wave loading early on in the design process. My research aims to develop a multi-fidelity framework to support early stage design exploration of novel and reliable vessels.

        It has been stated that noise is one of the main causes of not only structural damage but also hearing injury to species living around the noise source. A well-known noise problem is the sound produced by the process of driving an offshore monopile into the seabed, which is a common foundation used during the installation of wind farms. The current noise-control techniques used in this process still face challenges in reducing low-frequency noise, which can also be harmful to marine life. To overcome this limitation, this project proposes an elastic metamaterial-based structure composed by single-phase resonant structures. The proposed structure will be used to remove energy from the input signal related to high noise levels. The presented device opens the door for the development of less complex structures with potential in reducing noise directly from the source.

        Welded joints are often weak links in structures. Friction stir welding, originally developed for softer materials like magnesium and aluminium, has shown to be a very promising technique for manufacturing as well as weld repairs.
        However, friction stir welding in steel comes with its own set of problems. One of which is that steel undergoes phase transformations during the process, meaning that the mechanical properties of the material change. Moreover, the resulting mechanical properties of the joint depend on the welding parameters, such as the welding speed and rotation speed of the tool.
        Mechanical properties of friction stir welded joints in steel are not well understood. The project goal is to characterize and optimize the mechanical performance of friction stir welded joints in steel maritime structures. The current research is focused on static strength, fatigue strength and microstructural properties of friction stir welded joints in steel.

        In the last decade machine learning has become a buzzword in scientific modelling, but is this really a new universal approach or just a way to get new papers using regression methods that are 200 years old? In this presentation, I’ll highlight a few examples of the capabilities and limitations of applying modern machine learning to solve unsteady hydrodynamic problems. These range from the deseptively simple underwater pendulum to the well know open problem of predicting the forces induced by the turbulent wake of a circular cylinder. I will also discuss the critical role of the user in defining the problem representation and in applying the right machine learning tool for the right problem.
