      <p> A wave impacting the deck and superstructure of a ship is called green water. Green water is rare and complex and can be a danger to the ship and those aboard. During the design process, the risks that these events pose have to be mitigated, preferably by minimizing the probability of a large impact occurring. As green water events are rare and complex it is difficult to get a statistically representative data set, thus previous work has mostly compared design variations through a limited number of events, instead of comparing the probabilities. The present study uses probabilities to compare design variations. A large set of green water events in irregular waves with forward velocity was experimentally obtained for six different bow designs using a novel continuous testing facility. The resulting data gives us interesting insights, showing us the importance of using statistically representative data sets when designing for green water.

      <h3><b> Embracing Uncertainty in Optimization: Machine Learning-Based Approaches for Marine Propeller Optimal Design </b></h3>

      <p> Marine propeller design is a cornerstone of naval architecture and marine engineering, serving as a classic optimization problem that has captivated the attention of scholars, engineers, and practitioners for generations. The challenge lies in developing efficient, reliable, and cost-effective propellers that excel in various operating conditions while adhering to strict environmental regulations and addressing noise and vibration concerns. 
          As a critical component in the propulsion systems of ships, submarines, and other marine vessels, the marine propeller's design directly impacts vessel performance, fuel consumption, and emissions.
          Marine propellers often operate under uncertain conditions, including inflow, rate of revolutions, and manufacturing tolerances. 

          On the one hand, a deterministic design approach that does not consider these stochastic inputs can lead to excessive sensitivity to slight variations in operational conditions, resulting in a sub-optimal geometry for real-world functioning scenarios. On the other hand, the computational effort required to quantify the design's uncertainties may be prohibitive even when mid-fidelity solvers, like Boundary Element Methods (BEM), are employed in Simulation-Based Design Optimization.

          As in the case of deterministic design optimizations driven by mid-fidelity codes, Machine Learning methodologies represent a computational booster of the procedure. 
          By realizing computationally cheap yet accurate surrogate models of the key performance indicators of the design, they allow for the hundreds of thousands of calculations needed by sampling methods to evaluate the uncertainty of the design and drive the process towards configurations less sensitive to input variations, making the non-deterministic design optimization a feasible alternative to conventional deterministic design-by-optimization methodologies. 

          In this talk, deterministic and non-deterministic designs are carried out in the case of a conventional propeller, considering uncertainties of the nominal functioning conditions. 
          BEMs computations are used to train accurate Machine Learning-based surrogate models. Thanks to their cost-effectiveness in the forward phase, they enable the assessment of the uncertainties necessary for a non-deterministic design optimization framework. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, the optimal geometries attained through the utilization of surrogates are re-tested utilizing medium-fidelity BEM solvers to validate the superior performance of the non-deterministic design approach.
